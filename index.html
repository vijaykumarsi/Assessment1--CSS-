    <ol type="1" class="List1">
       <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
       <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen , paper , or in other media.</li>
       <li><b id="line-th"> CSS is not neccesary </b><b class="col-li"> CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li>
       <li>External stylesheets are stored inn CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="Box1"><i> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i> </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsI</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files . However, <b class="col-li"> in this tutorial we will use inline and Internal styles ,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to it yourself .
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.Id ia also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors availabel. Tow of thge most commonly used are class andc ID. Both are used to target the elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
